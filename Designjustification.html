However, a bit more entertainment could not hurt. The website is sweet and lovely, but not very fun. The About Us page is a bit corny-looking and it does not really look professional. I don’t know any big companies that have an introduction to the founders page.

The product page is a bit confusing for me, I don’t understand what the “main page” is supposed to be if all of the products are already inside the dropdown menu. I would suggest making either a main page for the products with buttons on their to the products or a dropdown menu that lists all of the products not both. </p>

The background of our website has the same color as the background of our logo and the headers, titles and buttons on or website have the blue color of the house within our logo. The paragraphs within our websites have the color black. For the font we used Google fonts, Spectral SC Regular 400 for all the paragraphs. For the headers and titles we used Spectral SC Extra Bold 800. We chose for extra bold as this makes the headers and titles pop-up more. We did not choose Italic as this makes the font harder to read.</p>

		<h4>Design elements </h4>
     <p> The target audience of our website are students between 18 and 25 years old, who have a busy schedule due to combining work, school and other activities. 
We hope that the students we reach with our website will actually take action and do something with our vision. Meaning they will find or create a safe space for themselves and take time to step out of reality and into a fantasy world. Because it is important to take a moment of self-care and emotional break. It reminds the people that they can still feel hopeful and passionate about life. </p>

	
		<p>Welcome page </p>
<p>For our welcome page we decided to show our vision and values, together with a carousel that shows images related to these. In the original design we created, this carousel should have contained images of our products. However, we decided that we already had a main product page and therefore we changed it to what we have now. </p>

		<p>About us page</p> 
<p>We created an about page in order to have more interaction with our target audience once they get to know the team behind the brand. For a lot of potential customers and investors, it is important to know who is in charge of which part of the brand and products, in order to contact these people with more precise questions. We have a contact page, but sometimes people just want a more direct answer from the right person. That is why the about list also contains our email contact information, that allows the audience to contact us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
		<p>Product pages </p>
<p>We created a galley of products, to make our website look like a webshop. We chose for a galley of products as we want to show our target audience a clear list of products. We believe that the look and feel of your product line is important in order for customers to join us in our Brand. We want to show all our products, so that the audience has enough to choose from and that potential investors have a broad idea of what we stand for. Within the webshop we first dit not want to show the costs of the products directly. We believed that showing the prices of products can scare of the potential customers. However, we received feedback from people, that it is more clear that the images represent product you can buy if you also add a price. So, that is what we did.</p>
		<p>Our product pages: </p>
<p>Books page: contains a carousel to show the books we sell clearly. With the arrows the audience can also click forward through the carousel. The boxes within the carousel contain a picture of the book and text with further information about the book. </p>
<p>Accessoires page: looks the same as the books page. This is also what we designed in our prototype. Both the pages contain material products and are designed to look clear and professional. </p>
<p>Trips page: contains a world map with our locations. To show the audience that, besides the trips we mention on the website, there are a lot of trips we offer in different continents all over the world. In our first design we wanted our map to have the option to click on the destinations. Sadly, this wasn’t doable for us within the coding techniques we learned. Therefore, we created the map Illustrator and added it as an image in our website. Besides the map, the website contains our most popular destinations, with a small summary of the country and trip. All trips have the option to click for more information. On the bottom of the trip page there is the option to send us your choice of trip. This makes it easier for the audience to choose a trip and for us to help the customer further in planning their trip. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
		<p>App page: we created an app for our brand. This page contains images on how our app works a looks like. We are not using a lot of words to explain the app, as the images on the page show clearly what our app can do and how customers can use it. In the end of the page there is an option to click on a download button.</p>
		<p> Testimonial page </p>
<p>We decided to add a testimonial page. Customer experience is always something other potential customers will look at. The product line might seem good, but only if the potential customers can see that other people enjoy the products as well, they are more willing to buy the products. Besides this, it will also give us as an organization more insight of what customers think of our brand, website and products. Therefore we not only want, but NEED testimonials on our website.</p>

		<p>Contact</p>
<p>Every website needs a contact page. It is important that if customers have problems with products or our website they can go somewhere. The contact page contains the option to send your question, but also the address we are located. Meaning that customers can also visit us on location. </p>


		<p>Social Media Icons</p>
<p>On our website you can find social media icons at the bottom of the pages. Mystic Feathers is also using several social media platforms to promote our brand and provide the audience with more information besides our website. The audience can click on the social media icons and visit our: facebook platform, instagram platform, youtube platform and spotify playlist.</p>
